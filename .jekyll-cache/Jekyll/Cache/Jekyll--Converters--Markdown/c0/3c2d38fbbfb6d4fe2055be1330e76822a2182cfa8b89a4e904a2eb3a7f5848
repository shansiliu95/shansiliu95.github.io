<p>I’m Yubo Zhang, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science, UNC-Chapel Hill, working with Prof. <a href="https://cs.unc.edu/people/stephen-m-pizer/">Stephen Pizer</a>. My research interests lie in deep learning approaches for medical image analysis and 3D reconstruction. In the first two years of my stay at UNC, I was working with Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/">Mohit Bansal</a>, focusing on language-and-vision grounding tasks.</p>

<p>I received my bachelor’s degree from the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University in 2018. During undergraduate studying, I spent the summer of 2017 at University of Southern California working with Prof. <a href="https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kuo/Chung-Chieh">C.-C. Jay Kuo</a>, focusing on medical image processing.</p>
