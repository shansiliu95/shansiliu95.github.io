# About Me

I'm Yubo Zhang, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science, UNC-Chapel Hill, working with Prof. [Stephen Pizer](https://cs.unc.edu/people/stephen-m-pizer/). My research interests lie in deep learning approaches for medical image analysis and 3D reconstruction. In the first two years of my stay at UNC, I was working with Prof. [Mohit Bansal](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/), focusing on language-and-vision grounding tasks.

I received my bachelor's degree from the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University in 2018. During undergraduate studying, I spent the summer of 2017 at University of Southern California working with Prof. [C.-C. Jay Kuo](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kuo/Chung-Chieh), focusing on medical image processing.
