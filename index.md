# About Me

I'm Yubo Zhang, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science, UNC-Chapel Hill, working with Prof. [Mohit Bansal](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/). My research interest is in language-and-vision grounding.

I received my bachelor's degree from Department of Automation, Tsinghua University in 2018. I spent 2017 summer in University of Southern California working with Prof. [C.-C. Jay Kuo](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kuo/Chung-Chieh), focusing on medical image processing.
