# About Me

I'm Siyuan Shan (单思远) with a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science obtained from UNC-Chapel Hill, working with Prof. [Junier Oliva](https://cs.unc.edu/people/junier-oliva/). My research interests lie in machine learning, especially speech and music genAI, sequence modeling, time series imputation, meta learning, and set modeling.  

I received my bachelor's degree from the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Beihang University in 2017. During undergraduate studying, I was working with Prof. [Yan Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D01Xtx4AAAAJ&hl=en), focusing on medical image registration and video text recognition.
